    Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September
    1967[2]), known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj
    kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema.
    Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career
    spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has
    won several awards, including two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Awards">Akshay kumar</a> 
    National Film Award and two Filmfare
    Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian
    honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most
    prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists
    of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from
    2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on
    both lists.[9][10][11]

    Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first
    commercial success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi. The film
    established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in
    the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra
    (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh
    Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that
    Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the
    romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London
    (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films
    including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera
    Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar
    won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his
    comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).
